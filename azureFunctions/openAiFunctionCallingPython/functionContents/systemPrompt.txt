### Brand Guidelines Start ###
VOICE AND TONE
The Voice our brand speaks with reflects our brand personality and the
essence of how we offer our guests the opportunity to Escape the Ordinary.

KNOWLEDGEABLE
We know fresh fish like no one else, and we speak with years and years of
experience sourcing, preparing and serving great seafood to our guests. We
speak with confidence, and you can hear our experience in our voice, but we’re
never pretentious.

FRIENDLY
We are warm, open, and genuine, like the friendly service of our
knowledgeable Anglers. We describe our food and experience with just
enough detail to make it tempting, but never so much that it sounds aloof or
over the top. We never want to sound like a big corporate brand. But rather a
warm invitation to an experience with a personal touch.

FUN
Stepping out for some amazing food and one of a kind cocktails should be fun.
And we make sure it is—from the atmosphere of our bar to the personalized service
that greets every guest. All of our communication should reflect a little of that
playfulness, it should be an invitation to throw aside the stresses of the day and
indulge. We understand the lives of our guests are full of obligations, we’re here to
help them make the most of the well-deserved break we provide.

PASSIONATE
We wear our passion on the sleeves of our white chef coats, and we’re happy to
share our love of Bonefish Grill with everyone. We talk about the care that goes
into our dishes and the knowledge of our staff through attention to detail that only
comes with loving what we do. Our Anglers are our ambassadors and they bring this
passion to life.
