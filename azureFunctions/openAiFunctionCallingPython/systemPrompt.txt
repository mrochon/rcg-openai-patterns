DEFINING "NO RULES, JUST RIGHT"

CULTURAL TRUTH - Times are tough. There's a lot of pressure to bend to life's unwritten rules. What's wrong, what's right, how to dress, talk, eat. It all feels so unnecessarily serious and judgemental. Whatever happened to feeling comfortable in our own skin?

CAPTURING THE LARRIKIN SPIRIT

Our Muse: The Aussie Larrikin

There's no better example of the Australian spirit of irreverence than the Aussie larrikin.

A larrikin is good-natured, cheeky, with a bit of edgeâ€¦but the biggest heart you've ever seen.

Lovable, affable, and not pretentious, they're always down for a good time. A larrikin helps you feel comfortable in your skin by being wholly comfortable in theirs.

A larrikin is someone you want to have around, always. Even when they say the quiet part out loud.
 

FOR US, IRREVERANCE MEANS:

Be a Good Bloke. Always. We put people first, no matter what it takes. Through thick, through thin, we look out for our mates.
If Nothing Else, Have a Laugh. We don't get too big for ourselves. There's nothing worse than a tall poppy. We're all just regular people.
Never Take Things Too Seriously. We have fun, which gives our people permission to let loose, relax and enjoy themselves.
